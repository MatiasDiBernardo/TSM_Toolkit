# TSM_Toolkit
Implementation of different time scale modification algorithms. This repository contains our own implementations of OLA (Overlapp-add), PV (TSM base on phase vocoder) and HPS (Harmonic Percussive Separator) algorithms. There are several tests made to evaluate the performance of the algorithms, and also, there are comparisons test with other implementations. All the details are in the report (written in Spanish). 

This code is part of the final project of my DSP class on UNTREF.
